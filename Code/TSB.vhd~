-- tri_state_buffer is a buffer controlled by
-- 'En' Control signal, that control the dataflow
-- from 'IP' to 'OP' that are Gereric Buses of width n
-- if 'En' is Deactivated, 'IP' is cutted from 'OP'.

Entity TSB is
   port( En,IP : in std_logic;
         OP : out std_logic);
end TSB;

Architecture RTL of TSB is
begin
    --Change when 'En' or 'IP' Change
    OP <= IP when En = '1' -- Transfer 'IP' to 'OP'
    else 'Z';  -- Cuttoff the 'OP'
